## 📌 Problem Statement

Given the number of study hours, predict the score a student is likely to achieve in an exam. This is a supervised regression problem using a simple dataset.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Name:** Student Scores Dataset  
- **Source:** [Kaggle – mexwell/student-scores](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/student-scores)
- **Features:**
  - `Hours`: Number of hours studied
  - `Scores`: Marks scored in exam

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- 📈 Linear Regression
- 📊 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 🐍
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- (Optional) Streamlit for web app

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

| Metric        | Linear Regression | KNN Regression |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Mean Squared Error (MSE) | 30.87 | 32.21 |
| R² Score      | 0.28              | 0.25           |

🔍 **Interpretation:**
- Both models show moderate performance.
- Linear Regression slightly outperforms KNN, which is expected due to the linear nature of the data.
